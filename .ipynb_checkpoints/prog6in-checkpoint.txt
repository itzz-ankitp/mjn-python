In this code, the sort_file_contents function takes two parameters: the name of the input file,  and the name of the output file.
The function uses the open method to open the input file for  reading, reads its contents into a list of lines using the readlines method, sorts the list using  the sort method, and opens the output file for writing. 
The sorted lines are then written to the output file using the write method, with the strip method used to remove any leading or  trailing whitespace from each line.
The resulting output file will contain the sorted contents  of the input file.
